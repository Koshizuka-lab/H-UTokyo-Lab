The University of Tokyo (“the University”) believes that the collaborative creation of knowledge, drawing not only from one discipline but bringing together a diverse and global perspective to connect the knowledge is imperative in resolving complex global issues faced by society. To date, the University has brought together the achievements from its many faculties to resolve issues as well as contributed to government policy. It is the vision of the University to serve as “a global hub for knowledge collaboration contributing to the 21st-century global society”*3 by promoting the synergy that will connect the “creation of knowledge” to “the use of knowledge.” Through the new Laboratory, the University is promoting collaborative creation between industry and academia by sharing visions and actively drawing on the synergy to enhance the creation of new value for society.

Hitachi, Ltd. (“Hitachi”) on the other hand, has been implementing Social Innovation Business that combines and leverages its vast experience in infrastructure technology and advanced IT, accelerating initiatives in collaborative creation with customers and partners, as well as through open innovation, to deliver the optimal solutions for societal issues by creating new value through digital technology.

The University and Hitachi decided to combine their respective efforts and collaborate under a new scheme of “collaborative creation (co-creation) by industry and academia” to create visions and innovations that can help realize a “Super Smart Society” (Society 5.0), which is expected to bring prosperity to humankind. We established the “H-UTokyo Lab” within the University to be the central command for such initiatives. This lab will undertake two projects. The first one is “Habitat Innovation,” where we have tried to create a smart city concept suitable for Society 5.0 and implement it in real urban settings. The other one involves “Energy” in which the energy systems that can support Society 5.0 are studied from various perspectives. Joint research is being promoted while sustaining organic collaboration between these projects. Moreover, we plan to actively share the content and results of such joint studies with the society by utilizing events such as open forums.

**_Urban Well-being of Smart City_**
> We're developing an Urban Well-being for Mega Cities concept, merging digital tech with urban space to enhance citizen life and value for its inhabitants.The key topics include connecting the Cyber and Physical worlds, creating a diverse information infrastructure known as Dataspace, incorporating AI, and establishing Interactive systems and Digital Communities to bridge cities and people. It also emphasizes the idea of 'Slow Digital' to lead a more fulfilling life. ​
> By adopting these concepts, we aim to move beyond merely the physical aspects of urban spaces and functionalities.
