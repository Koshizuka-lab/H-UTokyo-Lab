**_Urban Well-being of Smart City_**
> We're developing an Urban Well-being for Mega Cities concept, merging digital tech with urban space to enhance citizen life and value for its inhabitants.The key topics include connecting the Cyber and Physical worlds, creating a diverse information infrastructure known as Dataspace, incorporating AI, and establishing Interactive systems and Digital Communities to bridge cities and people. It also emphasizes the idea of 'Slow Digital' to lead a more fulfilling life. ​
> By adopting these concepts, we aim to move beyond merely the physical aspects of urban spaces and functionalities.
